We know **from experience it’s unruly to have all** of _our functions in the same_ file and scope. In this lesson we’re going to cover how to group functions and define a specialized map known as a struct in order to organize our code more efficiently.

## Problems _with_ **it**

Modules allow us to `organize functions into a namespace`. In addition to grouping functions, they allow us to define named and private functions which we covered in the functions lesson.

Let’s look at a basic example:

```idris
IntOrString : (isInt : Bool) -> Type
IntOrString True = Int
intOrString False = String
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the \*\*\*\*page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
